You are given two data sets. 
StudentClass.csv    this is students’ performance in 10 core classes after joining college. 
StudentGraduate.csv   this is the students’ background information, and if this student graduate on time.
The ID of this two data set can be matched.

Research question:
1.	Do students perform better in Morning class (before 12:00pm) or afternoon class? 
2.	Math, Physics and Statistics are considered quantitative classes. If a student take 2 or more quantitative classes in one semester, will he/she have lower average score?
3.	Which Major has higher quantitative class GPA?
4.	Can you combine two dataset and build a classification model to predict if a student can Graduate ON Time (Note: We cannot use the last 2 semester’s performance to predict the graduation, since it is too late to predict the graduation)
